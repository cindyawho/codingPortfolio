# codingPortfolio
 Hello! This repository will be where I save projects that I am proud of as I code more of my own personal projects.

I have taken coding classes in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C++, Python, and have really enjoyed coding!

On here, I hope to:
- create a website that shows my skills
- create pages that include my resume, past teacher curriculums, coding projects, and piano videos
- learn more about Github and coding
- publish unique pages with my personal coding projects
- share it all with others!

Thank you for reading and hope you have a nice day! :D
